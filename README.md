### Individual description of programmes

### Week 1
#### The inital week 1 task was not about the program helloworld.py which simply prints out Hello World
#### But was to make us familiar with the enviroment in which we would be writing and saving code.
#### Anaconda version of phython was installed in VScode and VScode was synced with a repository in GIthub to allow us push and pull information from github. To this end some of the important information learnt was to use the commands 
#### Git add .
#### git commit -m "commit message"
#### git push
#### input your passphrase
#### To pull down information from the lecture notes. I would have to be in the partiular folder in terminal and then use the command
#### Git pull 
#### Which would pull down the latest information from the git hub repository


### Week 2
#### Second weeks task was to write a program called bank.py that was to take two inputted ammounts in cents and sum these ammounts. Then finally convert to euros and print that total. Showed the use of the input function for taking in data into a program. Basic aritmatic in summing two values. Formatting and printing out of the total to the user.

### Week 3
#### The third task was the creation of accounts.py program. It was to read in a 10 digit account number and send back the same account number with the first 6 digits replaced with X's.
#### I learnt different ways to manipulate strings. To get the last 4 digits from the account number negative indexing was used to count back 4 digits from the end of the string of numbers and then splice these 4 numbers onto the 6 X's to complete the task.
